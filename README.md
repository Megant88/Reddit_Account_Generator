**Reddit Account Creator**

```
Hi, this is my second project ever so far, its a bit old I think 2 months.
The code is a bit messy but works since it was my second project.
This Tool creates accounts for Reddit.
```

```
It supports captcha.guru,2captcha.com,captcha.io and anti-captcha.com
Just put the name written like here into the config.
If you want to verify email you can use kopeechka.store
```

```
For imports just check generatorcode.py file


Sorry for this messy and rough readme.md I just dont know how to write them properly
Please leave a star or follow me, ive put work into this.
